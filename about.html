        <p>
          I still remember pacing outside my son’s bedroom door, heart pounding, trying to find the right words. 
          He’d had a rough day at school and had shut everyone out. In that moment I would have given anything 
          for someone who truly understood both of us — someone who could hand me the exact words that would 
          lighten him up.
        </p>

        <p>If you’ve ever stood in that same hallway, you’re not alone.</p>

        <p>
          Parenting teens is the hardest, most important thing most of us will ever do. We love fiercely, 
          we second-guess constantly, and sometimes we only know years later whether we got it right. 
          Wouldn’t it be easier if we had a wise, calm expert who actually knew our family — someone who 
          could coach us in the moment, in our own voice, in a way that lands with our teens?
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s why I built SageDash, a space where Sage can help you, me and other parents out there who are searching for the same guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sage is your personal parenting coach — an AI-trained parenting expert with decades of adolescent 
          knowledge and tens of thousands of real-life stories that worked. Answer a few quick questions 
          about you and your teen, and Sage begins learning your family’s tone and needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every <a href="/how-it-works.html#plans">Core</a> and 
          <a href="/how-it-works.html#plans">Soul</a> response is written in your voice, shaped by your 
          family’s profiles, and lands gently — whether it’s a short opener or a longer conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
          My hope is that Sage becomes the quiet ally who helps you turn everyday, tense, and exciting moments 
          into connection — one conversation, one dash, one stronger bond at a time.
