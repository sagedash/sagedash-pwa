          <p>
            Your teen brings home a great grade, wins a spot on the team, or nails a performance — and your heart swells.
            You want them to know how proud you are.
          </p>

          <p>
            But sometimes, after the “I’m so proud of you!” you notice something else: they seem more anxious, not less.
            They worry about “keeping it up,” and suddenly the win feels like pressure.
          </p>

          <h2>When praise starts to feel heavy</h2>
          <p>
            Teens can hear certain kinds of praise as a new standard they have to meet every time. For example:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“You’re so smart.” (Now I have to be smart every time.)</li>
            <li>“You’re our star.” (What if I mess up — do I stop being the star?)</li>
            <li>“You always do so well.” (What happens the first time I don’t?)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The intention is love. The impact can be fear of failure — or of disappointing you.
          </p>

          <h2>Shift from labels to specifics</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of global labels, try noticing specific choices, effort, or character. For example:
          </p>

          <p><em>
            “I saw how many times you rewrote that essay, even when you were tired. That focus and care really showed.”
          </em></p>

          <p>
            This kind of praise:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Connects your pride to things they can control (effort, attitude, persistence).</li>
            <li>Makes it safer to stumble — because your love isn’t tied to a perfect outcome.</li>
            <li>Teaches them what to repeat next time, without demanding the exact same result.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Keep wins separate from worth</h2>
          <p>
            Teens need to know that who they are matters more than what they achieve. You might say:
          </p>

          <p><em>
            “I’m proud of what you did, and I’m even more proud of who you are — kind, thoughtful, and willing to try.”
          </em></p>

          <p>
            Over time, this helps them build a sense of self that can survive both big wins and hard days.
          </p>

          <h2>A simple line that helps</h2>
          <p>
            The next time your teen has a big win, you might say:
          </p>

          <p><em>
            “I’m really proud of this result, and I’m just as proud of the way you showed up and kept going.
            One moment doesn’t define you — it’s part of your story.”
          </em></p>

          <p>
            It lets them enjoy the celebration without feeling trapped by it — and keeps the door open for honest
            conversations when things don’t go as well next time.
