            Your teen sees photos from a group hang they weren’t invited to. Or they hear about plans made in the hallway
            while they stood a few steps away.
          </p>

          <p>
            “It’s fine,” they say. But their face tells a different story.
          </p>

          <h2>Skip the “They’re not worth it anyway” reaction</h2>
          <p>
            It’s natural to want to protect your teen by dismissing the group: “You don’t need them” or “They’re being childish.”
          </p>

          <p>
            But right now, your teen may still want those friendships. Criticizing the group can make them feel even more
            alone — like no one understands why this hurts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead, try:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “Oof. Seeing that and not being included must really sting. I’m sorry that happened.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <h2>Normalize the pain without making it their fault</h2>
          <p>
            Teens are quick to turn exclusion into a story about their worth: “I’m annoying,” “I’m boring,” “They don’t like me.”
          </p>

          <p>
            You can gently counter that narrative:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “This says more about group dynamics than about your value. Good people are left out sometimes, and it feels awful.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <h2>Look for other circles, not just this one</h2>
          <p>
            Once the sharpest pain has softened a bit, you can help them notice where they <em>are</em> wanted. For example:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“Who do you feel more relaxed around, even if it’s just one or two people?”</li>
            <li>“Is there a club, team, or activity where you feel more like yourself?”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You’re not forcing them to “move on,” just reminding them this one group isn’t the whole map.
          </p>

          <h2>A simple line that helps</h2>
          <p>
            The next time your teen feels left out, you might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “Being on the outside of plans really hurts. It doesn’t mean you’re less likable — it means this group didn’t get it right today, and I’m here with you while it stings.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            It doesn’t erase the ache, but it tells them they don’t have to carry that ache alone.
