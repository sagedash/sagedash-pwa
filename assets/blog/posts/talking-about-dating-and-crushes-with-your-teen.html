            You overhear a name that keeps coming up. Or you see a text, a smile, a sudden urgency about how they look
            before school.
          </p>

          <p>
            Welcome to the world of teenage crushes and early dating — a place where your own feelings (pride, worry, nostalgia)
            can run just as high as theirs.
          </p>

          <h2>Show you can handle the topic</h2>
          <p>
            If your teen worries you’ll overreact, they’ll keep their love life hidden. You can lower the stakes by staying
            steady and curious.
          </p>

          <p>
            You might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “Sounds like you might really like this person. If you ever want to talk about it — or just roll your eyes about it — I’m here for that.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            You’re inviting conversation without demanding details.
          </p>

          <h2>Ask more about feelings than gossip</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of drilling for information — “Who is it?” “Do they like you back?” — try questions that help your teen
            notice their own experience:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“What do you like about being around them?”</li>
            <li>“How does your body feel when you see their name pop up?”</li>
            <li>“What feels exciting, and what feels stressful about this?”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This keeps the focus on their inner world, not just the drama.
          </p>

          <h2>Share your values in calm, short pieces</h2>
          <p>
            It’s important for teens to know your values around respect, consent, communication, and safety. But long speeches
            can make them shut down.
          </p>

          <p>
            Try sprinkling in short lines over time, like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“I care a lot that anyone you’re with treats you with real kindness.”</li>
            <li>“You never owe anyone access to your body or your time.”</li>
            <li>“You can always text me a code word if you need an exit.”</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>A simple line that helps</h2>
          <p>
            The next time you sense a crush or new relationship, you might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “I’m glad you feel safe telling me about this. You deserve someone who respects you, and I’m always here to
              help you sort out what feels healthy or not.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            It keeps the door open — so when dating gets complicated, they’ll know where to turn.
