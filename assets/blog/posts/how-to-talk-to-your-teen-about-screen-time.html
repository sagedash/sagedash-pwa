            It starts as a simple reminder — “Time to get off your phone” — and suddenly you’re in a full argument about
            fairness, friends, and “everyone else’s parents.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Screen time is a loaded topic for many families. It touches on freedom, social life, school, and sleep all at once.
            No wonder it turns tense so quickly.
          </p>

          <h2>Why screen limits feel so personal</h2>
          <p>
            For many teens, screens aren’t just entertainment. They’re:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Where their friends are.</li>
            <li>Where they relax after a long day.</li>
            <li>Where they escape when real life feels heavy.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So when you say “put it away,” they may hear “I’m taking away your only way to cope or connect.” They don’t
            always have words for that — it just shows up as defensiveness, eye-rolling, or a shutdown.
          </p>

          <h2>Start with shared goals, not rules</h2>
          <p>
            Before talking exact limits, it helps to name what you both actually care about. For example:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “I want you to have fun and stay connected to friends, and I also care a lot about your sleep and stress.
              Can we look at this together with both in mind?”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            This kind of line:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shows you see the good side of screens, not just the risks.</li>
            <li>Signals that you’re aiming for balance, not control.</li>
            <li>Makes it easier for your teen to stay in the conversation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Move toward a small, clear agreement</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of trying to fix every screen habit at once, focus on one area that matters most right now — like
            late-night scrolling or homework distraction.
          </p>

          <p>
            You might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “If we pick one small change to try this week — like phones out of the bedroom at 10 — what would feel
              most doable for you?”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            You’re still the parent, but you’re inviting them into problem–solving, not announcing a surprise rule.
          </p>

          <h2>A simple line that helps</h2>
          <p>
            The next time a screen-time fight is brewing, you might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “I’m not trying to take fun away. I want us to find screen rules that protect your sleep and stress and still
              leave room for friends. Let’s pick one small change and try it together.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            It turns screens from a constant power struggle into a shared project — something you’re working on side by side.
