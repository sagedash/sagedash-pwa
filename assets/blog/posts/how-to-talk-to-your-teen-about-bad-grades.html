          <p>
            The moment you see the grade, your stomach drops. A red C, D, or even F sits at the top of the page,
            and your mind races: “What happened? Were they careless? Are they falling behind?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Your teen already knows the grade isn’t great. What they don’t know yet is how you’re going to respond.
            And that response can either build trust or shut the door on future conversations about school.
          </p>

          <h2>What’s underneath a “bad” grade</h2>
          <p>
            A single grade can hide a lot: confusion, anxiety, procrastination, perfectionism, or simply too much on
            your teen’s plate. When you think about how to talk to your teen about bad grades, start by remembering:
            the grade is information, not a verdict on who they are.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your job isn’t to ignore the problem, but to stay curious about what the grade is trying to tell you both.
          </p>

          <h2>How to open the conversation</h2>
          <p>Try to lead with connection instead of interrogation. For example:</p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “Hey, I saw the grade on this test. I know that probably doesn’t feel great. Want to look at what happened
              together when you’re ready?”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            This kind of line:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Notices the grade without shaming.</li>
            <li>Signals that you’re on their side, not against them.</li>
            <li>Gives them a bit of control over timing.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Shift from blame to problem–solving</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of “Why didn’t you study?”, try questions that invite reflection:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“What part of this felt hardest for you?”</li>
            <li>“When did you feel most stuck or lost?”</li>
            <li>“If you could rewind, what would you want to try differently?”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You’re still addressing the issue, but in a way that says, “I believe you can grow, and I’m here to help.”
            That message matters far more than the letter at the top of the page.
          </p>

          <h2>A simple line that helps</h2>
          <p>
            The next time a rough grade shows up, you might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “This grade isn’t who you are. Let’s look at what tripped you up and choose one small thing to try next time.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            It keeps the door open for honest conversations about school — and protects their confidence while they learn.
