            The backpack hits the floor, your teen sighs, and the words come out: “There’s no way I can finish all of this.”
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s tempting to jump straight to solutions: “If you’d started earlier…” or “You just have to focus.” But when
            a teen is overwhelmed, logic alone doesn’t land. Their brain is flooded; they need calm first, then a tiny plan.
          </p>

          <h2>See the stress before the schedule</h2>
          <p>
            Before talking about priorities or time blocks, it helps to notice what they’re feeling. You might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “Wow, this does look like a lot. I can see why your brain is saying ‘nope’ right now.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            That one line tells them you’re paying attention, not just judging their effort.
          </p>

          <h2>Break the mountain into pebbles</h2>
          <p>
            Once they feel seen, you can gently move toward a plan. Teens often need help turning “all this work” into
            specific pieces. Try questions like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“What’s due tonight, and what’s due later?”</li>
            <li>“Which assignment feels smallest, even if you don’t want to do it?”</li>
            <li>“If we worked in 15-minute chunks, what would you start with?”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The goal is not perfection. It’s to get them started on one doable thing.
          </p>

          <h2>Offer support without taking over</h2>
          <p>
            It’s a delicate balance: being helpful without doing the work for them. You might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “I won’t do it for you, but I can sit nearby, help you sort what’s due when, or quiz you if that makes it easier.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            This keeps them in charge of their work, while reminding them they don’t have to power through alone.
          </p>

          <h2>A simple line that helps</h2>
          <p>
            The next time your teen feels buried in homework, you might say:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “This really does look like a lot. Let’s take a breath, list what’s due, and pick the smallest thing to tackle first. We’ll take it one piece at a time.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            It lowers the emotional temperature and turns a wall of work into a path they can actually walk.
